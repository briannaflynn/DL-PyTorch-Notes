# DL-PyTorch-Notes
Notes from diving deep into PyTorch for Deep Learning: General Concepts with Code Examples

Goes over:

- Why good initialization matters - and why we want activations to have a mean close to 0 and a standard deviation close to 1
- Variance, Standard Deviation, and Mean Absolute Deviation - when to use each and why
- Activation explosion - what it is, why it's bad, and how to prevent it
- Basic training loop
- Convolutions
- Callbacks and why to use them
- Math essentials
- Hooks (Pytorch's version of callbacks)
- When and why to use Softmax vs Binomial when interpreting activations
- Hyperparameter scheduling - Why treating a model differently at different stages of the training 'life cycle' often leads to better performance
- Batch Normalization
- Exponentially weighted moving averages
- Use of epsilon as a hyperparameter
- Small Batch / Batch of 1 Normalization Techiques
